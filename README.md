# Client-Experience-Data-Analysis-Using-Google-Sheets
This project involves analyzing client experience data to understand key performance metrics related to service access, problem resolution, and client satisfaction. The dataset includes various scores that reflect how clients perceive the urgency of their issues, ease of access to services, the effectiveness of solutions provided, and their likelihood to recommend the service.

The goal of this project is to identify trends, patterns, and potential issues within the client experience data, such as drops in scores over certain periods or disparities in service access. By visualizing this data in Google Sheets, we can highlight critical insights, such as the impact of service changes on client satisfaction or specific time periods where client experience dipped.

The analysis focuses on creating time series charts, stacked bar charts, and comparisons to understand the behavior of various metrics across periods. Furthermore, the project explores equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) aspects, providing recommendations on how to enhance service delivery for underrepresented and vulnerable groups. This approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of client experiences, leading to more informed policy decisions and improvements in service accessibility and satisfaction.
